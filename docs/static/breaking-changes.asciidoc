== Breaking Changes

We strive to maintain backward compatibility between minor versions (6.x to 6.y,
for example) so that you can upgrade without changing any configuration files.
Breaking changes are usually introduced only between major versions (such as 5.x
to 6.y). On occasion, we are forced to break compatibility within a given major release
to ensure correctness of operation.

This section covers the changes that you need to be aware of when migrating to
Logstash 6.0.0 and later.

NOTE: Migrating directly between non-consecutive major versions (1.x to
6.x) is not recommended.

See these topics for a description of breaking changes:

* <<breaking-pq>>
* <<breaking-6.0>>

See also <<releasenotes>>.

[[breaking-pq]]
=== Breaking change across PQ versions prior to Logstash 6.3.0

If you are upgrading from Logstash 6.2.x or any earlier version (including 5.x)
and have the persistent queue enabled, we strongly recommend that you drain or
delete the persistent queue before you upgrade. See <<upgrading-logstash-pqs>>
for information and instructions.

=== Breaking changes in filebeat input plugin
Please note that logstash with filebeat input plugin prior to version N.N.NNN is not compatible with filebeat version 6.3.0 or above. See [filbeat breaking change](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/master/breaking-changes-6.0.html#breaking-changes-ls-index) for details.

[[breaking-6.0]]
=== Breaking changes in 6.0

Here are the breaking changes for 6.0. 

[float]
==== Changes in Logstash Core

These changes can impact any instance of Logstash and are plugin agnostic, but only if you are using the features that are impacted.

[float]
===== Application Settings

* The setting `config.reload.interval` has been changed to use time value strings such as `5m`, `10s` etc.
  Previously, users had to convert this to a millisecond time value themselves.

[float]
===== RPM/Deb package changes

* For `rpm` and `deb` release artifacts, config files that match the `*.conf` glob pattern must be in the conf.d folder,
  or the files will not be loaded.

[float]
===== Command Line Interface behavior

* The `-e` and `-f` CLI options are now mutually exclusive. This also applies to the corresponding long form options `config.string` and
  `path.config`. This means any configurations  provided via `-e` will no longer be appended to the configurations provided via `-f`.
* Configurations provided with `-f` or `config.path` will not be appended with `stdin` input and `stdout` output automatically.

[float]
===== List of plugins bundled with Logstash

The following plugins were removed from the 5.0 default bundle based on usage data. You can still install these plugins manually:

* logstash-codec-oldlogstashjson
* logstash-input-couchdb_changes
* logstash-input-irc
* logstash-input-log4j
* logstash-input-lumberjack
* logstash-filter-uuid
* logstash-output-xmpp
* logstash-output-irc
* logstash-output-statsd
