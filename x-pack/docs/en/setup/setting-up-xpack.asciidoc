== Setting Up X-Pack

{xpack} is an Elastic Stack extension that provides security, alerting,
monitoring, machine learning, pipeline management, and many other capabilities. 
By default, when you install Logstash, {xpack} is installed. 

If you want to try all of the {xpack} features, you can 
{xpack-ref}/license-management.html[start a 30-day trial]. At the end of the 
trial period, you can purchase a subscription to keep using the full 
functionality of the {xpack} components. For more information, see https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions.
