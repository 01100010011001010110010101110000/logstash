     * <p>
     * For options, I think '2' (log) should be the default. This would save plugin authors complexity
     * and they can just write:
     * <p>
     * dlq.write(...)
     * <p>
     * and the user's configuration will determine how this behaves.

     * Commentary: An alternative to `implements UsesDLQ` is to use annotations. Example:
     *
     * @param dlq
     * @Inject private DeadLetterQueueWriter dlq;
     * This would imply the plugin builder would need to ask this plugin for any '@Inject' annotations on fields.
     * If any are found, check the type, and determine if this is some injection we support.
     * I am not sure of this idea, even though it looks nice. My concern is that `implements ...` enforces
     * compile-time checks on types/etc that annotations would not (without lots of effort?).
     * For now, dependency injection I am finding to feel safer using interfaces than annotations. Discuss.
